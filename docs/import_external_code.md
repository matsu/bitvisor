# Importing external code to BitVisor

This document provides a guideline on how to import external code to BitVisor.

1. Don't forget to update LICENSE file for newly added code.
2. Leave version information somewhere. For example, it can be on the path like
   `path/to/[external_code-version]`. It can also be a note in the imported
   code folder. With this information, we can cross-check with the upstream
   later to see whether the imported code needs to be updated or not.
